```

### Deprecated
[![stability-deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-deprecated-922b21.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#deprecated)

Code changes are planned. Do not rely on the current functionlity. Use of the feature may cause warnings. Backwards compatibility should not be expected.

```markdown

```

### Experimental
[![stability-experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#experimental)

Code is new and may change or be removed in future versions. Please try it out and provide feedback. If it addresses a use-case that is important to you please open an issue to discuss it further.

```markdown
[![stability-experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#experimental)
```

<a href="https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#experimental"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg" alt="Experimental"></a>
```

### Alpha
[![stability-alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-alpha-f4d03f.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#alpha)

Code is functional but volatile and prone to breaking changes. Feature development is in progress and solutions are being validated.

```markdown
[![stability-alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-alpha-f4d03f.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#alpha)
```
```html
<a href="https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#alpha"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-alpha-f4d03f.svg" alt="Alpha"></a>
```

### Beta
[![stability-beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-beta-33bbff.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#beta)

Code is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered mature. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.

See also, the [productionisation checklist](PRODUCTIONISATION-CHECKLIST.md).

```markdown

```

### Release Candidate
[![stability-release-candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-pre--release-48c9b0.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#release-candidate)

Code is fairly settled and is in use in production systems. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained unless serious issues are discovered and consensus on a better solution is reached.

```markdown
[![stability-release-candidate](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-pre--release-48c9b0.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#release-candidate)

```

### Mature
[![stability-mature](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-mature-008000.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#mature)

Code has proven satisfactory and is ready for production use, cleanup of the underlying code may cause some minor changes. Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.

```markdown
[![stability-mature](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-mature-008000.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#mature)

```

### Frozen
[![stability-frozen](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-frozen-0000CD.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#frozen)

Code has been tested extensively in production and is unlikely to ever need to change.

```markdown
[![stability-frozen](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-frozen-0000CD.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#frozen)

```

### Locked
[![stability-locked](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-locked-4b0088.svg)](https://denpamusic.github.io/software-guides/STABILITY-BADGES.html#locked)

Code is complete. Unless serious bugs are found, this software will not ever change.

```markdown
